In this README I'll explain the installation process of VS Code, Python and Jupyter.
1. Install the Python extension for VS Code and Python
First install Visual Studio Code, if it is not already on your machine.

Next, install the Python extension for VS Code from the Visual Studio Marketplace. Open VS Code and click the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of VS Code. Search for Python and install the Python extension (it is named Python and it's published by Microsoft). It's probably the first in the list:

Click the Install button.
Along with the Python extension, you need of course to install Python as well, if it is not already on your device. Go to python.org/downloads and use the Download Python button that appears first on the page to download the latest version:

To verify that you've installed Python successfully on your machine, open a command prompt and run the following command:
py -3 --version
You should see something like
Python 3.10.7
